# TravellingNotes
My notes from some places I have visited. I use these notes when I travel to the same destination again. Feel free to use them and you can also contribute via pull requests.

## General info

### Why GIT?
Because you can clone to repository and make it accessible offline. You can also make changes locally and push (or pull-request) later when needed. (This repository contains human-readable notes only, so I do not care so much about commit messages. `git diff` tells more.)
