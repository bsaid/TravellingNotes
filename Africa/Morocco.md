## Transport
- Trains: [https://www.oncf-voyages.ma/](https://www.oncf-voyages.ma/)
  - The website [https://www.oncf.ma/](https://www.oncf.ma/) looks deprecated.
  - Compatible with Supratours bus lines [https://www.supratours.ma/](https://www.supratours.ma/). It is possible to buy one ticket for train and corresponding Supratours bus.
  - Tickets are sold at the train station, the price does not change with time. It is usually possible to buy a ticket 30 min before departure.
  - There may be long queues at the ticket counters.
  - The ticket machines and online ticket reservation system probably does not accept interational credit/debit cards.
  - First class is only a litle bit more expensive than the second class.
  - Second class is usually 8 places in a coupe, First class usually 6 places. (Bmz, Bmpz types, sometimes Ampz)
  - Usually old style toilets, but sometimes they have vacuum toilets in the first class.
- CTM buses: [https://ctm.ma/](https://ctm.ma/)
- Taxi:
  - Petit taxi (small, usually red) operate only inside cities, they do not take you to the airport.
  - Grand taxi is more expensive and takes you almost everywhere.
  - Shared taxis are also quite popular. Sometimes, it is possible to join a group at the train or bus station.
- Airport transfers:
  - Petit taxis operate inside cities only. They do not go to the airport.
  - It is possible to go by petit taxi to the border of the city and then walk to the airport.
  - Petit taxi from Fes (centre) to the "Oulad Tayeb" (closest point to the Fes airport) should cost around 70 MAD.
  - The prices are usually higher (maybe double) at night, but it is a point of negotiation with the driver.
  - Petit taxi approximate prices with taxameter enabled: 2 MAD boarding price + 3 MAD/km
  - Petit taxi may share your ride with someone else, everybody pay his own charge by distance.
  - Grand taxis always go to the airport, but they are expensive:
    - 150 MAD per journey from the city to the airport during the day, the price is per car, not per person
    - 200 MAD at night (20 - 08).
    - Sometimes they want the price in EUR (15 EUR during the day, 20 EUR during the night), because it is more profitable for them.
    - If you book a taxi and then you want to cancel it because you have found somebody else to join, then you will be maybe charged a fee (maybe up to 50 MAD). It depends on the driver.
  - Buses go to the airport from train stations during the daytime, usually between 08 - 20h. They ususally go every hour, but sometimes it is not easy to find them. The ticket price for the bus is only around 5 MAD.

## Accomodation
- Hostelworld: [https://hostelworld.com/](https://hostelworld.com/)
- Booking: [https://booking.com/](https://booking.com/)
  - Some properties on Booking are scam only. Some of them do not exist and they will try to charge you as "not arrived".
  - Check description and conditions for the properties. If the property asks you for a payment outside booking.com (for example PayPal), there is high probability of dishonest beahvior.

## Money
- Revolut: [https://revolut.com/](https://revolut.com/referral/bedric1jpv!FEB2-23-AR-H1)
- Western Union: [https://www.westernunion.com/](https://www.westernunion.com/)
- I do not recommend to take Moroccan money outside the country, they have some restrictions about that. Maybe we are allowed to take up to 2000 MAD through the Morrocan border.
- Exchange offices are usually very expensive, especially at the airports.
- ATMs usually accept international debit cards, the withdrawal fee is between 30 - 35 MAD. (Plus the fees charged by your bank.)

## Phone and data
- Maroc Telecom has better coverage outside cities. Inwi is slightly cheaper.
- SIM card costs 30 MAD, plus 10 MAD for each 1 GB of data. They have separate credit for calls and for data.
- I recommend to top up around 10 MAD for calls (when you need to call the local hotel, hostel, accomodation) and 20+ MAD for the data based on your needs.
- SIM cards can be easily purchased in the cities, they are usually expensive at the airports.
