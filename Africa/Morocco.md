- Taxi:
  - Petit taxi (small, usually red) operate only inside cities, they do not take you to the airport.
  - Grand taxi is more expensive and takes you almost everywhere.
  - Shared taxis are also quite popular. Sometimes, it is possible to join a group at the train or bus station.
- Airport transfers:
  - Petit taxis operate inside cities only. They do not go to the airport.
  - It is possible to go by petit taxi to the border of the city and then walk to the airport.
  - Petit taxi from Fes (centre) to the "Oulad Tayeb" (closest point to the Fes airport) should cost around 70 MAD.
  - The prices are usually higher (maybe double) at night, but it is a point of negotiation with the driver.
  - Petit taxi approximate prices with taxameter enabled: 2 MAD boarding price + 3 MAD/km
  - Petit taxi may share your ride with someone else, everybody pay his own charge by distance.
  - Grand taxis always go to the airport, but they are expensive:
    - 150 MAD per journey from the city to the airport during the day, the price is per car, not per person
    - 200 MAD at night (20 - 08).
    - Sometimes they want the price in EUR (15 EUR during the day, 20 EUR during the night), because it is more profitable for them.
    - If you book a taxi and then you want to cancel it because you have found somebody else to join, then you will be maybe charged a fee (maybe up to 50 MAD). It depends on the driver.
  - Buses go to the airport from train stations during the daytime, usually between 08 - 20h. They ususally go every hour, but sometimes it is not easy to find them. The ticket price for the bus is only around 5 MAD.

## Accomodation
- Hostelworld: [https://hostelworld.com/](https://hostelworld.com/)
- Booking: [https://booking.com/](https://booking.com/)
  - Some properties on Booking are scam only. Some of them do not exist and they will try to charge you as "not arrived".
  - Check description and conditions for the properties. If the property asks you for a payment outside booking.com (for example PayPal), there is high probability of dishonest beahvior.
